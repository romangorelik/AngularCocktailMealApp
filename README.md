Made an old React project where I call data from both a cocktail and a meal API.

Display both of them from your search, and on the like button it displays the name of the product up top. The nav bar helps you move from either cocktail or meal.

Practice using:
ngModel
@Input()
@Output()
routingModule
HttpClientModule
